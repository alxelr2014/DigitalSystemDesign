\chapter{ASM Chart}
\thispagestyle{headings}

The \textbf{algorithmic state machine} is a method for designing finite state machines which describe the sequential operations of a digital system. Its a behavioral model using flowcharts suitable for LSI.

There are three main elements to a ASM chart.
State box, conditional box and a decision box.

in state and conditional boxes, the commands takes one clock cycle to be executed. conditional box is combinational. decision box contains binary expressions. \textbf{ASM block} is composed of one state box and all the decision and conditional boxes connected to the exit path of the state box. It represents what happens in the system during one clock cycle.
